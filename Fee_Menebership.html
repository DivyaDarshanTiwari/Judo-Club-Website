    <h1>Judo Training and Membership Fees</h1>
   <div>
   <h2> <b>Section 1.</b> For the first month of training</h2>
   <p>a &#41 Juniors and Seniors membership for Judo Classes. Prior to your first class, unless you want to pay your Judo NSW registration up-front , new members must obtain a "Trial Membership" from "Judo NSW". This is done on-line and there is no cost at the time of registering for your trial period. Through the Trial Membership, Judo NSW provides a 4 week no-obligation trial period for new members which includes insurance coverage.  Please note that for the Wednesday Dinos class (for 4 and 5 year old pre-school kids), the MONS class (for kids turning 5 to 8 years in the year who attend school), and for the Monday Senior (turning 15 years or older in the year), intake of new members occurs ONLY for the first 2 weeks of each school term. Therefore, for the MONS and Senior classes, please don't obtain a "Trial Membership" from Judo NSW" until JUST PRIOR to your first class, as the month trial period is triggered from the registration. New members (Not Mini-Kids membership for children in the Dinos Class) can register their trial membership with Judo NSW as follows. </p>

    <h3>Budokan Judo Club Training Fees.</h3>
   <p>a &#41 Judo Club also offers a no obligation one month trial period before a commitment must be made regarding training fees. This takes effect during the Judo NSW Trial Membership period. Options for training fees are provided later in this document. Should a new member decide to continue to train after the one-month trial period, club training fees become due and will be back-dated to the first session. Please be proactive in paying for your training fees.</p>
   <p>b &#41  If new members leave after the one month trial period, there is no cost. If new members wish to pay training fees up-front, this is also possible.</p>

    <h2>Section 2. After the One-Month Trial Membership Period</h2>
    <p>The annual membership fee to Judo NSW and Judo Club training fees are both required to be paid at the time the respective one-month trial memberships expire, or beforehand if you choose that option. Both fees are retrospective covering the one-month trial period.</p>
